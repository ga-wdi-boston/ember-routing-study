## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
History- it uses HTML5 History API
Hash which uses an anchor based URL
Auto which can use either
and None which is set by design
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
don't start with / because this will go back to the root and not just to the path you want the object
to be found.
for the history API you need to use pushState with the state object, title and URL
```
