## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
Ember matches a URL to a specific view state. The router specifies the destination route, and the route uses the model to gather data and display it via template.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URLs are URLs with '#'. They load the starting state of the app and keep the app in synch as a user moves around different view states. The URL after the # blocks data sent to the server, so data is not transmitted.

Hash URLs should be used for GH pages, though the history APi is the default. Setting the the ENV.locationType is done in config/environment.js. 
```
