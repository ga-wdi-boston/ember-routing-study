## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
Every possible state in an Ember application has a specific URL. The route
handlers use URLs to load the requested/current view state.


```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URLS are used to load the starting state of your ember application. Unlike
some of the other frameworks we have learned about, hosting an ember application
on GitHub pages requires several more steps(which I cannot seem to understand,
exactly). To use 'history', the user must have support from the browser. 
```
