## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
When the URL is set, the mber router maps the current URL to one of the route handlers, which can render the template, load a model that is available to the template, redirect to a new route or handle the actions that involve changing a model or transitioning to a new route.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URLs separate the server side URL part of the URL from the portion used by Ember, which results in a hash change.
When deploying to github pages, you checkout a gh-pages branch, copy the app build into the route of the repository, add relevant files and commit and push the changes.
If you use the history API, your server must be configured to use your Ember app in response. 
```
