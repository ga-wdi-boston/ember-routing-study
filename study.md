## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
The Ember router parses the Url, the route links the Router to a particular view
and loads the UI data from the model hook.

```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
The information after the hash in your URL is read by the js in your file, not the server.

When you using github pages for your deployed app, you need to need to make sure
you specify the location type in the .env file.

If you want to use a history API instead of hash for location, your server must serve the Ember app from all the routes.

```
