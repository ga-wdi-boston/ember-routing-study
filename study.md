## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
Ember uses routes to use URL to load view-state. The following layers are responsible for their respective task.
Object Model: Augments Javascript objects with computed properties, inheritance, mixins and other useful functions.
Routing: displaying templates, loading data, parses the URL
Models: properties and behavior of the data
Components: gives feature to the route such as passing actions
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URLs are anchor-based URLs. It is basically read by your js file, not the server.
You need to need to make sure you specify the location type in the .env file.
Your server must serve the Ember app from all the routes if you want to use the history API I believe.
```
