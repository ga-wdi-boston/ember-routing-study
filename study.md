## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
Ember uses URL to load view state by identifying that whatever comes after the hash in the URL, to load that route name.

The Route - loads the appropriate data from the model
The model - holds the data in which the page will eventually render
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URL's are anchor-based URL's.

when deploying to GH pages, it is important to :
- not prefix CSS image paths with a "/"
- to make sure config/environment.js includes the following code :
- if (environment === 'production') {
  ENV.baseURL = '/project-name';
  ENV.locationType = 'hash';
}
-
Use ember build --environment production to build the project to dist/.
- then push to GH-Pages
```
