## Ember and URLs

In your own words, how Ember "stops breaking the web".

```md
Ember's router uses specific URL's to decide when to send and recieve data from
the backend. Ember uses consistent URL structure throughout any given Ember page.
```

## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
Ember uses four options to manage URLs being history, hash, auto, and none.
History uses the HTML history api to produce URLs. The hash option loads the
beginning state of the app and keeps it in a current state. This is what Ember
uses to load current view-state.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URLs separate the server side URL portion of the URL from the
portion that Ember uses.
```
