## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
Ember's router manages the URL, so depending on the URL it can either load data from the browser history (`history`) or take the anchor/starting state and sync up as the user moves (`hash`)... basically it lets the URL pick the view... Or if we don't want the URL to be involved (for testing reasons, for example), we can set the router `ENV.locationType` to `none`.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URLs are anchors, so when we use a hash it'll take us to whatever content the hash points to.
Not sure what you're looking for in the GitHub question, other than it takes a little bit for gh-pages to update the changes.
To use the `history` API I think you'd just set `ENV.locationType = 'history'`
```
