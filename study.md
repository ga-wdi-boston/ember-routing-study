## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
An Ember router maps the URL to a route which then renders a template and feeds information from the correct model into that template.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
A hash url has the anchor url on the left and then where in the document/viewport you are to the left of the '#'.  This can change as you scroll through the page looking at different parts of the document.  Basically, it allows a user to use the Back button to simulate having different pages in a SPA.

When deploying to GitHub pages, reference image data with a path and remove any slashes from the beginning of the path.

You don't have to do anything.  The default is 'auto', which will look for the history API before defaulting to hash.
```
