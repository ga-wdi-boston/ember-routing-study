## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
The URL acts as instructions to Ember's router of which model to display.  THe routes tell the view layer which model(s) to render.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URLs are a technique for telling certain JS frameworks the routing for displaying content - everything after the hashbang is the route (but is not recognized by many web crawling/indexing bots, and does not handle HTTP status messages without JS).  On gh-pages, the `ENV.location` setting in production needs to be set to `hash`, since the github pages servers are not configured to handle the `history` setting.  To use the `history` API, one must use and ember-ci addon called `ember-cli-github-pages`.
```
