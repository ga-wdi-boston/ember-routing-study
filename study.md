## Ember and URLs

In your own words, how Ember "stops breaking the web".

```md
Ember preserves URL structure while maintaining seamless integration of SPA
```

## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URLs maintain a list of the user's "history" in the URL by loading the
starting state of the app from the "anchoring" hash.

When deploying to gh-pages, it's important to remember to build into the
dist/ directory and copy the files located there, rather than pushing the
whole ember app.

In order to use the history API, you need to have your server configured to
respond appropriately to the user navigating directly to different routes
```
