## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
Ember maps the url to a view-state. The route is specified in the router, and the route models the ember data using templates and components.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URLs are URLs with #'s in them. They keep the starting state synced as a user moves around in an app preventing the use of the back button. They also hide anything after the # from the server and from most search engines which is not preferred.

Paths should not be prefixed with '/'. Ensure that environment.js has a locationType and baseURL set.

If you want to use the history API instead of hash your server must serve the ember app from any url the user might enter in directly as opposed to navigating to through the app itself.
```
