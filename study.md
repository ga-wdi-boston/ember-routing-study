## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
The router directs to a specific route. The route then utilizes the model hook to know which model to refer to in the model layer. Then, that gets passed along to the appropriate template for the route so the correct data is rendered in the browser.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash urls look like this: '/#/posts/new' and use the hash anchor as the basis for how the initial state of the app will look so that as you move around from there you have that base. The router has four options for url handling, and hash is one of them. Be aware of how you reference images and also be sure to use dist/ directory for deploying on Github. If you wanted to use the 'history' api you'd have to be sure to change where ENV.location points.
```
