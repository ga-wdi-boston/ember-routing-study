## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
<!--The URL is parsed by the router, which decides where that points to, loads
the appropriate view, which has data and models corresponding to it.
URL->ROUTER->VIEW VIEW has DATA generated by associated MODEL


 -->
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
<!--
Hash urls are basically routes with a # dividing resources to the left of it and
location to the right and when they're called, they direct the browser to that
location within the page. Much in the same way you can use a hash url to
navigate the page scroll from links in your nav bar to corresponding section
links on the same single page. It's doing that but with more view states.

GH-pages -- you need to remove the slashes in relevant paths as on gh pages they
will be accessing full paths on the HTTP server instead of relative ones.

Technically nothing, as far as I understand it. The ember defualt is set to
auto, which will default to the API history.
You can make changes to this config setting in the following file
 <config/environment.js> under <ENV.locationType>.

```
