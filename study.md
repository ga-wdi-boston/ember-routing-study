## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
Ember parses the URL via the router, communicates with the model to retrieve the correct data and then displays it via the template associated with that model.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URLs use the URL's anchor to load the starting state of the app.  Then it keeps it in sync as a user moves around the application.

It looks like the hash method is required for GitHub pages.  You also need to make sure that images are referenced using relative paths and not absolute paths.

If you want to use the `history` API instead of `hash` then your app must be served from all of the URLs defined in the Router.map function.
```
