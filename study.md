## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
Ember uses a router to define the content of a certain path.  That router then
passes data to a model, which feeds the appropriate data to a template that
displays it.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URL's are app-specific url locations.  I believe, from the reading(s), that
they require the app to be loaded before they can be accessed, whereas non-hash
url's will load the app at that place? Not entirely sure about this one.

To use the history you need the HTML5 history api and defined routes to the url
in your ember app.
```
