## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
A router is defined for a particular route/action. When that route is requested with the URL, the route handler for the specified route uses the model hook, which loads the appropriate template. The template is what renders the HTML/Htmlbars.

```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URLS are the # located in the middle of a domain. When requested, it directs the browser to the appropriate location. When deploying to GitHub, the filepath referenced cannot have the '/' before. If not specified, auto is used by default, which will automatically use the HTML5 History API.


```
