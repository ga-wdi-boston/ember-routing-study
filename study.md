## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
It uses a Hashbang. I am having trouble undestanding what hashbang actually
does. I need to see it in action to undestand what happens.

History: the browser produces URLs using it's history API.
Hash: the anchor of the URL loads your application's starting state.
None: URL doesn't have any effect on the app.

```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
- Hash URLs are how you access some data that you havenâ€™t written specific url paths to.
However, I do not understand what that means and need to see it in action to
understand this.
- When using GitHub pages, keep an eye out for your image paths.
- Having trouble understanding how history and hashes work and their purpose..
```
