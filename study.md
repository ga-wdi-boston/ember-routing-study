## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
Ember uses the browser history API for the URL. Each different URL is tied to a different
view state.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
The hash option uses the URL's anchor to load the starting state of your application and will keep it in sync as you move around.
If you are using a hash based URL it needs to be noted in config/environment.js.
if (environment === 'production') {
  ENV.baseURL = '/project-name';
  ENV.locationType = 'hash';
}

```
