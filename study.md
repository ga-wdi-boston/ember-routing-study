## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
In Ember everything starts with parsing the url string, which sets off a chain
of events that results in the user seeing what we want him to see. The router
parses the url to determine the proper route, then moves to the proper model
hook and onto the route template and then component.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash urls use a # to navigate with an application and keep tracking of changing
view states. They can be used in place of the history API, as some browsers do
not support history. When you deploy to git-hub pages you have to pay attention
to the urls provided for images, and make sure to ember build.
```
